# Dog Breed Classifier

## Overview

The goal is to develop an algorithm that can be used in a mobile or web app. The algorithm accepts user-supplied images as input and, if a dog is detected, provides an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it gives an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

## Project Files

- **dog_app.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and instructions.
- **add_on_images**: Directory containing additional images for testing the algorithm.
- **report.html**: HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook.

## Running the Notebooks

To explore and run the code, you need to have the following:

- Python installed
- Jupyter Notebook installed

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shradhamaria/Dog-Breed-Classifier.git
    cd Dog-Breed-Classifier
    ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and test the dog breed classifier.

## Project Steps

The notebook is divided into separate steps, each focusing on a specific task:
- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dogs
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Write your Algorithm
- Step 6: Test Your Algorithm
